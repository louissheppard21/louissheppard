            <h2>Overview<br>
              <br>
              
            </h2>
            <p>The Open Championship is one of the world’s most prestigious sporting events, attracting a global audience of fans, players, media, and commercial partners. I was engaged to lead the <strong>experience strategy and design</strong> for a multi-year transformation to dramatically change the way fans interacted with The Open digitally, this spanned attracting viewership, event marketing, ticket sales, and live event coverage.</p>
<h2>The Challenge<br>
      <br>
      </h2>
            <p>Despite its status as a premier global sporting event, The R&amp;A (golf’s governing body and organizers of The Open) faced several critical threats:</p>
<ul>
        <li><strong>Global Competition:</strong> Intense competition for fan attention as rival sports brands invested heavily in modern engagement techniques.</li>
        <li><strong>Monetization:</strong> Increasing difficulty in monetizing audiences across a fragmented landscape of broadcast and digital platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: A perception among potential fans that golf is difficult to understand or connect with.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Share:</strong> The need to remain competitive against other Majors and capture the lucrative US audience.</li>
	<p>To address these, the R&amp;A needed a stronger commercial focus to attract the next generation of fans, with the digital experience identified as central to this.</p>
            
      </ul>
          

            <h2>Discovery<br>
            </h2>
            
            <p>The transformation was sequenced around immovable event dates, making on-time delivery critical. We planned activities across three distinct phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pre-event: </strong>Discovery, engagement, and ticket sales.</li>
                <li><strong>Live Event: </strong>Digital experiences for both global and on-site fans.</li>
				<li><strong>Post-event:</strong> Year-round content consumption.</li>
                
          </ul>
            <p>For research we embedded with content teams, journalists, data and scoring teams on-site during The Open. Desk research included detailed review of sports data, digital analytics, and of the audience research already completed by The R&amp;A.<br>
              <br>
            I designed a program of work that began each phase with cross functional workshops and ideation exercises to generate concepts, then tested these with fans and validated technically, allowing us to move through design sprints with more confidence and having critical questions answered upfront.</p>
			
			<h2>Designing the experience<br>
          </h2>
            
            <h3>Reimagining Ticketing</h3>
            <p>The R&amp;A had a five-year goal to sell out The Open for the first time in its history. Our audit showed that while fans arrived with high intent, the existing platform suffered from significant abandonment at every stage.</p>
			
			<ul>
                <li><strong>The Solution: </strong>We redesigned the ticket builder to show clear package configurations, upsells and scarcity, with high-impact landing pages introduced to build excitement and momentum from the first step.</li>
                <li><strong>Narrative Selling:</strong> Working with content teams, we created unique &quot;stories&quot; for each tournament day, giving fans a sense of the distinct personality and choice of each experience.</li>
				
                
          </ul>
         
             <p><strong>Year-Round Digital Presence</strong></p>
             <p>The website was repositioned as a 365-day destination. The design balanced editorial storytelling with practical services, archival information, and The Open TV for showing highlight compilations and original content. </p>
			
			
			
		<p><strong>The Live Event Experience</strong></p>
             <p>The live event was central to the overall experience and designed to digitally recreate the energy of being on course, with 150 players to follow and multiple sporting narratives continuously developing. Key was to provide easily digestible quick content for fans whilst allowing them to move seamlessly through experiencing the action through data, scoring, video, player tracking, editorial and commentary.<br>
               <br>
               A strategic aim was to consider how to serve both existing and new fans, making the experience simple and compelling for anyone, but not watering down for those who wanted more detail.<br>
               <br>
               We considered the design of the platform from two layers, where the first “Interest Layer’ relied only on simple interactions and short form information, and a secondary ‘Insight Layer’, that could be triggered with richer detail and more customisable controls.<br>
               <br>
             Key features of the experience included:</p>
			
			<ul>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Commentary:</strong> A live feed using rich cards to highlight developing narratives and visually represent important moments.</li>
                <li><strong>Leaderboard:</strong> Configurable to showing different types of scoring and, as the highest traffic area of the experience, designed to intelligently trigger onwards journeys into other high value content.</li>
				<li><strong>Player Score Cards and Taxonomy:</strong> Player scorecards were designed as hubs of data and content, pulling live and highlight information together. A player taxonomy meant any mention of a golfer could allow a fan to trigger the scorecard view.</li>
                <li><strong>Automation:</strong> An underlying logic managed live event states, automatically surfacing relevant content and removing the need for manual reconfiguration during the fast-paced tournament.</li>
				<li><strong>Custom publishing interface:</strong> Designed specifically for content teams to create tag and push content as rapidly as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>Companion App:</strong> We developed a native live experience app with additional features for attending fans, this included wayfinding and the ability to locate players and plan routes through the course based on what they wanted to see.</li>
				
                
          </ul>
			
			

            <h2>Impact<br>
              <br>
            </h2>
            <p>The program transformed the way The Open engaged with its fan base and provided a foundation for strong commercial performance, supporting the future success for the 150 year old Championship.<br>
               
         <ul>
                <li><strong>Ticket Sales:</strong> Sold out for the first time in 150 years (achieved 5 years ahead of target).</li>
                <li><strong>Digital Revenue:</strong> 76% increase in attributable revenue during the live event.</li>
                <li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> 250,000 new membership sign-ups from the first event.</li>
                <li><strong>Service Efficiency:</strong> We used regular cross team reviews to share progress and learning and add fidelity to our design system. Critical challenges could be quickly identified and support provided to maintain energy and momentum.</li>
			 <li><strong>Engagement:</strong> Ability to contract and manage services with zero manual intervention.</li>
