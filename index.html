                <p>Biffa, a major UK waste utility provider, was embarking on a multi-year transformation to embed digital self-service across its SME and enterprise customer base. The goals were to drive revenue growth, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce reliance on manual service operations — fundamentally changing how the business delivered its service.<br>
                  <br>
                I led experience strategy and design teams across the programme, ensuring delivery stayed focused on research-driven customer outcomes aligned to commercial and operational goals.<br><br>

                    <h3 class="grid-subhead" style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>The Challenge</strong></h3>
                    <p>Biffa’s existing service model relied heavily on phone-based sales and support, with fragmented systems and highly manual operational processes. This had created:</p>
					<ul class="project-bullets">
                        <li>Long lead times to start or change a service</li>
                        <li>High operational cost and errors</li>
                        <li>Poor visibility for customers over contracts, collections and billing</li>
                        <li>Flatlining SME sales and high service desk dependency</li>
                    </ul>
					<p>At the same time, the space was heavily regulated and operationally risky — mistakes in pricing, service configuration or waste compliance could have serious financial and legal implications.</p>
					<p>The challenge was to design simple, trustworthy self-serve journeys that could scale commercially without creating unacceptable business or compliance risk.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>My Role</strong></h3>
					<p>I lead design and product strategy across the programme, responsible for:</p>
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Setting the experience vision and long-term product direction</li>
                        <li>Leading and coaching a team of designers across multiple workstreams</li>
                        <li>Planning and running research to inform product strategy</li>
                        <li>Partnering with Product, Engineering and Delivery leads on roadmaps and trade-offs</li>
                        <li>Leading design teams through problem solving and framing opportunities</li>
                        <li>Acting as the interface between design teams and senior business stakeholders</li>
						 <li>Ensuring design decisions were grounded in operational reality and data availability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Discovery & Strategy</strong></h3>
                    <p>At the outset, I planned and led a comprehensive research programme combining:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Customer interviews across SME and enterprise segments</li>
                        <li>Quantitative surveys</li>
                        <li>Call listening sessions with sales and service desks</li>
                        <li>Stakeholder interviews across operations, compliance, finance and IT</li>
                       
                    </ul>
					 <p>This surfaced a set of consistent unmet needs:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Customers wanted to start, change and manage services online without waiting for callbacks</li>
                        <li>Price transparency and service configuration were confusing and error-prone</li>
                        <li>Stakeholders lacked confidence that changes made digitally would be executed correctly</li>
                        <li>Internally, teams lacked a shared view of the end-to-end customer journey</li>
                       
                  </ul>
					 <p>Using these insights, I led the creation of:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>A future-state customer journey covering acquisition, onboarding, service management and billing</li>
						 
                        <li>A modular experience framework to support very different customer types without fragmenting the product</li>
                        <li>A set of design principles balancing simplicity, trust and operational safety</li>
                       
                  </ul>
					<p>These artefacts formed the foundation of the product vision and roadmap.</p>
					


                <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Key Product Decisions & Trade-offs</strong></h3>
                  
					<p>Rather than launching full self-serve for all customers at once, I recommended a phased approach, this was to help reduce regulatory and operational risk while showing early commercial value:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Phase 1: SME eCommerce onboarding</li>
						 
                        <li>Phase 2: Core self-serve account management</li>
                        <li>Phase 3: Enterprise tooling and complex service changes					</li>
				  </ul>
				    <p>There was a need to serve highly diverse customer needs. We  designed modular patterns that could adapt for different customer types without fragmenting the experience or adding unnecessary technical complexity, we desinged for:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Small owner-operators</li>
						 
                        <li>Multi-site enterprise customers</li>
                        <li>Broker ‘re-sellers’ of services</li>
						  <li>Different waste types and service frequencies					</li>
				  </ul>
				    <p>I prioritised service design head of detailed interface design, modelling backstage operations and data dependencies before finalising UI patterns. This ensured:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Interface designs were grounded in real operational constraints</li>
						 
                        <li>We didn’t design journeys that the business couldn’t fulfil</li>
                        <li>Engineering teams could identify upstream system changes early</li>
				
                       
                </ul>
				  <p>We encountered areas where significant complexity was slowing progress, for example for how to configure service contracting for larger site numbers or where there were additional regulatory considerations such as hazardous waste types.</p>
				  <p>I reccomended de-prioritsing these and refocusing on more typical scenarios with higher customer volumes, and waiting to validate these with concrete quantative data, then building in other journeys later on based on higher confidence that our core patterns were working.</p>
					<h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Delivery &amp; Cross-functional Leadership</strong></h3>
                <p>Working closely with Product, Engineering and Delivery leads, I:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Shaped a multi-year roadmap aligned to both commercial targets and operational readiness</li>
						 
                        <li>Facilitated senior stakeholder workshops to align on scope, sequencing and risk appetite</li>
                        <li>Coached a team of designers across parallel workstreams, introducing shared rituals, critique sessions and review standards to maintain quality and consistency</li>
                        <li>Acted as a buffer between design teams and a highly complex stakeholder environment, allowing designers to stay focused on agreed outcomes while I managed competing business pressures</li>
                        
                       <li>Stepped in hands-on to solve critical design challenges where they were blocking delivery, particularly around complex service configuration, pricing transparency and contract changes.</li>
				
                       
                  </ul>
					
					<h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>The Products</strong></h3>
                <p>The programme delivered a connected ecosystem of products, including:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>An SME eCommerce platform allowing customers to contract and start a waste service entirely online (an industry first)</li>
						 
                        <li>A self-serve customer portal enabling all customer types to manage contracts, collections, invoices and service changes</li>
                        <li> Modular design system supporting consistent delivery across multiple product teams</li>
                        
				
                       
                </ul>
					
					
				<h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Outcomes &amp; Impact</strong></h3>
				   <ul class="project-bullets">
                     <li>61% increase in SME sales, significantly exceeding targets</li>
						 
                      <li>38% reduction in service desk calls, lowering operational costs</li>
                      <li> Faster service onboarding times from 5 days to under 15 minutes with fewer manual processing errors.</li>
					   <li> A measurable cultural shift toward customer-centred decision making, driven by visible commercial impact</li>

                    <p>First Bus’s customer experience was fragmented across multiple digital products, physical touchpoints, and regional operating models. Key issues included:</p>
					<ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Inconsistent journey experiences across regions</li>
                        <li>Poor orchestration between digital and offline touchpoints</li>
                        <li>Limited personalisation and customer insight</li>
                        <li>Revenue opportunities being constrained by operational silos</li>
						<li>No shared view of the end-to-end customer journey</li>
                </ul>
					<p>At the same time, the organisation was preparing for a large-scale transformation investment, and senior leadership needed a credible, evidence-led vision to justify funding and align regional stakeholders.</p>
                    
                    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>My Role</strong></h3>
					<p>I was responsible for:</p>
                    <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Leading experience strategy and product vision development</li>
                        <li>Running discovery and research to inform strategic direction</li>
                        <li>Facilitating cross-functional alignment across product, engineering, data, and operations</li>
                        <li>Designing future-state journeys and ecosystem concepts</li>
                        <li>Supporting the business case for transformation at executive level</li>
                        
						
                </ul>

                    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Discovery & Strategy</strong></h3>
                    <p>I led a structured discovery phase combining:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Stakeholder interviews across operations, regional leadership, marketing, data and IT</li>
                        <li>Review of customer research and service desk calls and social posts.</li>
                        <li>Current-state journey mapping to expose fragmentation and duplication</li>
                        <li>Working with engineering and data leads to identify data and integration gaps</li>
                       
                </ul>
					 <p>This work surfaced a set of critical insights:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Customers struggled to navigate fragmented ticketing and account experiences</li>
                        <li>Lack of joined-up data limited personalisation and loyalty opportunities</li>
                        <li>Regional operating differences were preventing consistent product delivery</li>
                        <li>Revenue growth depended on better orchestration of digital and offline moments</li>
                       
                </ul>
					 <p>Using these insights, I led the creation of:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>A future-state end-to-end customer journey</li>
						 
                        <li>An ecosystem vision showing how apps, websites, on-bus experiences and customer service would work together</li>
                        <li>A set of experience principles aligned to revenue and growth goals<br>
                        </li>
                        
                       
                </ul>
					<p>These artefacts directly informed the strategic roadmap and business case.</p>
					


                <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Key Product Decisions</strong>					</h3>
                <p>Rather than developing a roadmap based on individual product features, I advocated for designing the full end-to-end journey first. This allowed us to:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Identify the most commercially impactful moments</li>
						 
                        <li>Ensure future work would not be duplicated across product teams</li>
                        <li>Plan a roadmap around customer value, not technical convenience					</li>
			    </ul>
				    <p>We developed frameworks that could support regional variation without fragmenting the product. This meant:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Standardising information architecture and data models</li>
						 
                        <li>Allowing controlled variation for local needs</li>
                        <li>Avoiding a one-size-fits-all rollout that would fail regionally					</li>
			    </ul>
				    <p>I led cross functional design workshops then used these as a basis to develop high-fidelity journey concepts. These served to bring the overall vision to life and to unlock stakeholder buy-in with tangible outputs, rather than relying solely on strategy decks.	These	were		    data-enabled and technically validated ensuring they were feasible for future implementation.					</p>
				    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Delivery &amp; Cross-functional Leadership</strong></h3>
                <p>Working closely with Product and Engineering leads, I:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Shaped a transformation roadmap aligned to commercial and operational goals</li>
						 
                        <li>Facilitated co-design workshops with design, product, engineering and customer service teams</li>
                        <li>Mediated competing priorities between regional leadership and central product teams</li>
                        <li>Ensured design concepts were technically validated and operationally viable</li>

                    <p>The existing eCommerce experience was built on legacy systems with a deeply flawed product taxonomy and fragmented user journeys. This resulted in:</p>
					<ul class="project-bullets">

                        <li>Coaching design teams across web, app and POS</li>
                        <li>Partnering with Product and Engineering on roadmap sequencing</li>

                </ul>

                    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Discovery & Strategy</strong></h3>
                    <p>I led a cross-functional discovery phase that included:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Current-state journey mapping workshops</li>
                        <li>User testing to identify navigation and discovery failures</li>
                        <li>Search analytics and keyword data analysis</li>
                        <li>Competitor benchmarking of taxonomy models</li>
                       
                </ul>
					 <p>This revealed that:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>The existing product taxonomy was fundamentally misaligned with customer intent</li>
                        <li>Search and navigation issues were structural, not cosmetic</li>
                        <li>Early platform decisions would lock in long-term failure if not corrected</li>
                       
                       
                </ul>
			    <h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Key Product Decisions & Trade-offs</strong>					</h3>
			    <p>I brought these findings to Product and Engineering leadership and made the case for rework despite timeline pressure, challenged the assumption that we should proceed with platform development before fixing the taxonomy. Instead, I proposed:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>A full redesign of the product classification model</li>
						 
                        <li>Alignment of taxonomy to customer mental models</li>
                        <li>Tree testing to validate findability improvements</li>
                       
                </ul>
					
                    <p> This delayed some platform work but prevented long-term compounding failure.					This required trading short-term delivery speed for long-term product viability.					</p>
                    <p>I modelled user flows and backstage operations to surface:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Business rules adding unnecessary friction</li>
						 
                        <li>Risk management constraints blocking simple journeys</li>
                        <li>Opportunities to simplify account management and pricing logic</li>
				
                       
                </ul>
				     <p> Working with product leadership we brought these findings to business leaders and used prototypes and user flows to model alternative journeys, helping to promote discussion and then change on underlying business rules.</p>
					<h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Delivery &amp; Cross-functional Leadership</strong></h3>
                <p>Across the programme, I:</p>
					 <ul class="project-bullets">
                      <li>Coached designers embedded within delivery teams</li>
						 
                        <li>Introduced shared critique and review standards</li>
                        <li>Mediated conflicts between delivery speed and product quality</li>
                        <li>Presented strategic trade-offs to senior stakeholders</li>
                        <li>Established a design system to ensure consistency at scale</li>
                       <li>Stepped in hands-on to prototype and test critical flows where they were blocking progress.</li>

				<h3 class="grid-subhead"><strong>Outcomes &amp; Impact</strong></h3>
				   <ul class="project-bullets">
                     <li>Prevented a flawed taxonomy from being locked into new infrastructure</li>
						 
                      <li>Significantly improved product discoverability and reduced search failure in early testing.</li>
                      <li>Created a scalable design system adopted across teams</li>
