                    <p>After their inaugural season getting their new league off the ground, LIV Golf needed a complete fan engagement ecosystem to bring their championship to the largest audience and build the fanbase to make them sustainable into the future.</p>

<p>We worked to get them from 0-1 for tee off of the first event of the first full season, then scaled rapidly up as they grew their own operations. The work covered event marketing, ticketing, store, fantasy, 12 team websites, and full coverage of all the sport with scoring, data, streaming and stories for both global fans and those attending on course.</p>

<p>Key to delivering on their strategy was providing an experience that radically shifted expectations around the game of golf and captured new audiences. Through all moments we needed to consider how to make it feel exciting and accessible for everyone, while not diluting for core golf fans.</p>

<p>Working with teams across the business and directly with c-suite I set out the experience vision and digital strategy, helped plan the roadmap with product owners, and provided direction to design teams and hands-on execution. I also worked closely with LIV Golf’s growing brand team to take their visual system from a logo and a font, into a fully fledged brand experience across digital and physical touch points.</p>

                    <p>First Bus were shifting their focus from a business model prioritising operating efficiency, towards achieving new revenue growth, looking ahead to an investment in technology, data and the customer experience to do this. I worked in a cross-functional team to set the vision for their future state customer experience and set the foundations needed for getting this implemented.</p>
					<p>I led the creation of a current and future state customer journey map through facilitating workshops across the business, reviewing customer feedback data and calls, and working with analytics teams to find pain points across digital interactions. The final future-state journey demonstrated a complete picture of how interconnected products and off-line touch points would be orchestrated to drive the revenue targets the business had set, and what technology, data and content were needed at each stage.</p>
					<p>There was also a need to support the business case and sell the vision to execs and regional network heads. I did this through developing interface designs and storyboards to bring the journey to life and to solve for long standing customer experience challenges. Rather than purely conceptual these were designed for real world operations and data and robustly validated, ready for implementation.</p>

                    <p>Arup are pre-eminent in the world of engineering and design, responsible for some of the most iconic and seemingly impossible built environments, including Sagrada Familia, Sydney Opera House and London’s Elizabeth Line. With thousands of projects completed every year and a highly diverse expertise delivered through 99 global offices, they had struggled to articulate a single, clear proposition and voice.</p>
					<p>I provided product strategy, creative direction and design leadership for a project to build their new global website and turn the businesses new strategic positioning into something that would be accessible and tangible for customers. Arup’s previous attempts to transform their digital experience had stalled as discovery became bogged down in debate, so rather than re-open this I designed a program around design-led exploration and definition, prioritising tangible outputs over broad conceptual ideas to give clarity and build consensus.</p>
					<p>I worked closely with Arup content teams to make sure key messaging was aligned to strategic aims, and to design narrative patterns to bring clarity and consistency to their storytelling. A key need was also to be able to provide high-level insight, without losing any technical depth. We used the concept of macro and micro interactions where detail could be triggered where needed, supported by a network taxonomy to cross-link content and build journeys based on customer intent.</p>

With awareness that they and their sector had lagged behind other utilities providers in adoption digital self-serve, they embarked on a multi year transformation to address flat lining sales, manual operational reliance, and to bring greater customer centricity across the business.</p>
					<p>I planned and led customer research, provided service design for mapping out of current and future journeys and systems, and led experience design teams. Work was split across two phases, the first focused on acquiring and on-boarding new customers, where the key challenge was turning complex and legislatively heavy contracting into a simple self-serve journey, then rethinking back-stage systems to allow a customer to get up and running with bins on site without manual intervention.</p>
					<p>The second phase was design of a customer portal and connected services, allowing any customer to manage all of their service online with reporting, tracking, booking, invoicing and support. Critical here was to design a solution that could efficiently serve any type and size of customer, from single-owner operators to enterprise operations managers responsible for large, distributed service estates. We did this through modular, flexible patterns that adapted to different goals without fragmenting the experience.</p>

					<p>I led research to speak with customers around the world, distribution partners and internal specifier and sales teams. The business had planned to end its production of the printed product catalogue, which had been the cornerstone of sales and specification activity, so there was a critical need to make sure this would not be disrupted through moving online, and that we find ways to better support these teams.</p>
					<p>The solution provides the ability to explore product ranges, find inspiration and application ideas, enable content teams to build rich product stories, and provides all the technical detail and configuration options needed. It was delivered through an experience layer and visual system that reflected iGuzzini’s strong industrial design heritage.</p>

					<p>With a reliance on manual process and operational teams on the ground to deliver the service, Speedy had fallen far behind competitors and their transformation plan was intended to fundamentally change they way they did business and delivered the their service, with investment in logistics, data and customer experience.</p>
					<p>Using service design methods and working with stakeholders across the business I designed the future state customer journey and developed the vision to join up thinking across multiple teams and initiatives. Key early on was to ensure strong foundations for scaled delivery, this included a complete redesign of the catalogue product taxonomy and creation of a design system to guide both product decision making and interaction design principles.</p>
					<p>Through the program I provided design direction to teams and hands-on execution where needed. The work included not only detailed journey and interaction design, but rethinking underlying business rules and processes. Using design-led activities to make the impact of operational decisions visible and then rethink how services should be delivered.</p>
					<p>The program is ongoing with the eCommerce platform due to launch FY2026.</p>
