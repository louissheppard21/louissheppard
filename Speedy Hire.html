            <h2>Overview<br>
              <br>
              
            </h2>
            <p>Speedy Hire, the UK’s leading provider of tools and equipment hire, embarked on a multi-year transformation to modernize its customer proposition. Operating in a market increasingly defined by speed and self-service, the business needed to strengthen its digital position. I was engaged to provide experience strategy and design leadership, working across business, product, and technology teams to define a digital vision and provide direction for internal and agency design teams.<br>
               <br>
          The roadmap includes a new e-commerce website (due Q1 2026), a customer portal, a native app, and a new point-of-sale interface for depot staff.            </p>
            <h2>The Challenge<br>
              <br>
            </h2>
            <p>While Speedy Hire possessed strong operational capabilities, its digital ecosystem faced several critical hurdles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fragmented Experience: Inconsistent journeys across web, mobile, and in-store touchpoints.</li>
                <li>Organizational Silos: Product structures and navigation were driven by internal logic rather than customer intent.</li>
                <li>Manual Friction: A high reliance on manual processes and limited self-service options, particularly for high-value corporate accounts.</li>
                <li>Competitive Pressure: The rise of digital-first providers offering faster, more intuitive hire journeys.</li>
            
            </ul>
             <p>The goal was to redefine the digital proposition while creating internal alignment to support change at pace.<br>
             </p>

            <h2>Strategic Approach<br>
            </h2>
            <h3>Discovery and Customer Vision</h3>
            <p>We began with a discovery program that combined cross-functional workshops, journey mapping, and customer interviews across corporate, trade, and retail segments. Our key insight was that customers weren't struggling with Speedy’s offer, but with finding, configuring, and transacting within it. The central need of every customer type was unmet:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Tradespeople with high knowledge but time poor, encountering slow performance, multiple hurdles to purchase and product navigation not aligned to their understanding.</li>
                <li>Corporate customers lacking reporting and suitable bulk ordering ability for manging multiple large-scale projects.</li>
                <li>Retail DIY customers lacking knowledge and guidance on the suitability of products.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Working with Speedy teams I mapped the current state customer journey and desired future state. </p>
            <p>Using this to identify work phases, product boundaries and dependencies. This also provided clarity for all teams on how separate initiatives would work together to achieve customer outcomes.</p>
            
            <h3>Unified Product Taxonomy</h3>
            <p>A major barrier to a good experience was an inconsistent product taxonomy that limited search and navigation. I led a design-led initiative to audit these structures and redesign the taxonomy around customer mental models. Using mapping exercises supporting by sales data, web analytics and AI tools to model competitor structures.</p>
         
             <p><strong>Experience Principles</strong></p>
             <p>To ensure consistency, I distilled research into Experience Principles that acted as decision-making guardrails for product and design teams, these were:</p>
			
			<ul>
                <li>Speed to value for the customer.</li>
                <li>Reduction of cognitive load.</li>
                <li>Alignment between customer intent and presented options.</li>
		  </ul>
			
			<p>Key to the design vision was a balance in achieving brand distinction with simplicity of use and performance. We prioritised simplicity at key decision making moments with branded accents based on bold, light weight executions. The aesthetic needed to have a clear voice but also support a sense of momentum and directness through the journey.</p>

            <h2>Design Thinking driving business change<br>
              <br>
            </h2>
            <p>During journey mapping, we discovered that many customer pain points weren't caused by interface design, but by underlying business rules. Issues like complex account creation, inconsistent fraud checks, and ambiguous overdue charges were driving high abandonment rates.<br>
               <br>
            Rather than treating these as isolated design problems, I used prototypes as decision-making tools to show stakeholders the impact of their operational choices. We modelled alternative structures that reduced customer friction without increasing business risk. This allowed the organization to move from &quot;defensive, risk-led&quot; decisions to balanced trade-offs between control and commercial performance.            </p>
            <h2>Execution &amp; Scalability<br>
              <br>
            </h2>
         <ul>
                <li><strong>Design System:</strong> I led the creation of a comprehensive design system to support scaled delivery across multiple product teams. This included components, patterns, use cases and checklists, as well as guidance on applying interaction, messaging and brand principles</li>
                <li><strong>Commercial Focus:</strong> We mapped KPIs directly to design tasks, ensuring that every feature—from smart category filtering to simplified account creation—was grounded in improving measurable performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Outcome led planning:</strong> By planning the phases around journey segments from our experience map I was able to set clear boundaries and briefs for teams, with challenges and opportunities mapped to each stage to solve for.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment and momentum:</strong> We used regular cross team reviews to share progress and learning and add fidelity to our design system. Critical challenges could be quickly identified and support provided to maintain energy and momentum.</li>
         
		  </ul>
			<h2>Impact<br>
			  <br>
          </h2>
					<p>While the full website launch is slated for early 2026, the engagement has already delivered significant value:</p>
<ul>
           <li><strong>Customer:</strong> Validated navigation and journeys; restructured flexible payment/account options.</li>
           <li><strong>Operational:</strong> A shared vision aligning multiple teams; strategic assets (journey maps, taxonomy) reused across initiatives.</li>
           <li><strong>Commercial:</strong> Foundations laid for improved conversion and a KPI framework for long-term measurement.</li>

              <h2>The Speedy Way: A little reflection.</h2>
                <p>‘The Speedy Way’ was I phrase I heard quite a bit early on from people across the business. It didn’t really have a fixed meaning, mostly I took it to mean a kind of no-nonsense, can-do positive spirit, and occasionally it was used a bit ironically, like when acknowledging certain things could be done better but that’s not how they did them.</p>
                <p>This wasn’t an official tagline, I’d never seen it any brand guidelines, but it showed there was something under the surface of the business, an understanding between colleagues that there was something unique in the people, processes and mindsets there.</p>
                <p>At some level all organisations have this, an underlying energy, hard to put your finger on exactly but there. It might be called a brand or culture but these don't seem quite right.<br>
                  <br>
              The more I worked with the business the more I could see it in action. In the way people went about things, made decisions, solved problems. Depot staff talking a customer through how to use a certain plate compactor, customer services teams having a joke with a builder who had called to complain about something. That type of thing.</p>
                <p>It was something I latched on to and found myself using, particularly as a useful way to frame a question or look at a problem, ‘if we did this differently what would you say should be the Speedy Way of doing it’. It was something that seemed to chime with people and trigger focus.</p>
                <p>When writing the design system documentation I did add a definition for what 'The Speedy Way' translated into for design, but it didn’t really capture all the things I felt it could mean.<br>
                  <br>
              How interactions work, length and tone of messaging, immediacy of information, journey design, information architecture, round or square buttons? Big and small all these decisions are a part of bringing that unique spirit to life in some way. </p>
                <p>Through all the work on this program I feel my overarching aim was to make ‘The Speedy Way’ into something tangible for customers in a way that felt valuable for them, and that everyone in that business would recognise as true. </p>
